## ADR Queue

Milestone 0 identifies these future decision topics:

- Parcel-source precedence: city GIS, county assessor, Esri, GeoJSON, and manual override order.
- Staff-only precedent visibility and retention.
- Zoning determination disclaimer language.
- CivicCode citation handoff and section-resolution failure behavior.
